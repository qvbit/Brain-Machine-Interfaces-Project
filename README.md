# Neural Networks and Deep Learning Project

This repository contains the code and dataset for training a CNN and RNN to classify EEG readings into one of four motor imagery classes. CNN and C-RNN implementations achieve goal accuracies. The other architectures are experimental and therefore still need some work...

2020 Update: This project and code is very old and crude but just adding report here for readability and completeness.
